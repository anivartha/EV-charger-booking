#dbms project steps:

🖥 Terminal 1 — SQL Shell (psql)

This one shows your database side:
Run these in order (you can copy directly):

\c ev_booking
\dt                     -- show all tables
SELECT * FROM stations; -- show some existing data


Then demo a function and a trigger:

SELECT make_booking(1, 1, '2025-11-06 10:00:00+05:30', '2025-11-06 11:00:00+05:30') AS booking_id;
SELECT * FROM bookings ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
SELECT * FROM logs ORDER BY event_time DESC LIMIT 3;

You’ll see:

new booking created

ports status auto-changes via trigger

logs entry created (via trigger)

Then cancel it:

SELECT cancel_booking(<booking_id>, 1);
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE booking_id = <booking_id>;
SELECT port_id, status FROM ports WHERE port_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM logs ORDER BY event_time DESC LIMIT 3;


➡️ shows function + trigger working.

🖥 Terminal 2 — PowerShell (Backend)

Show this already running:

🚀 Server is running on port 3000
📡 Environment: development
🗄️  Database: ev_booking @ localhost


Then open your browser and visit:

✅ http://localhost:3000/health (you already did this)

✅ http://localhost:3000/api/stations (lists stations)

✅ POST /api/bookings (to create a booking, optional if time allows)
